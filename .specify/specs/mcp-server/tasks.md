# Tasks: n8n-MCP Server Maintenance & Enhancements

**Input**: Existing implementation analysis from `/Users/quantum_craft/_DEV/n8n-mcp/.specify/specs/mcp-server/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/
**Status**: âœ… IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Maintenance & Enhancement Tasks

## Execution Flow (maintenance mode)
```
1. Load existing implementation analysis
   â†’ Already implemented system with 2,883 tests
   â†’ 536+ nodes, <100ms performance, multiple deployments
2. Identify maintenance categories:
   â†’ Performance optimizations
   â†’ n8n compatibility updates
   â†’ Feature enhancements
   â†’ Documentation updates
   â†’ Security improvements
3. Generate maintenance tasks by priority:
   â†’ Critical: Security, compatibility, performance
   â†’ High: New features, bug fixes
   â†’ Medium: Documentation, code quality
   â†’ Low: Minor enhancements, cleanup
4. Apply task rules for maintenance:
   â†’ Independent tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
   â†’ Sequential tasks for related changes
   â†’ Testing tasks prioritized (TDD maintenance)
5. Number tasks sequentially (M001, M002...)
6. Focus on enhancement, not initial development
```

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Sequential Dependencies

- M005-M008 before all other tasks (security first)
- Testing tasks (M017-M020) can run parallel to implementation
- Documentation (M021-M024) depends on feature completion

- **Performance**: No regression in <100ms response time targets
- **Quality**: Test coverage maintained above 80%
- **Documentation**: All features documented and up-to-date

## Notes

- [P] tasks = independent components, safe for parallel execution
- All tasks include specific file paths for immediate implementation
- Tasks prioritize system stability and user experience
- Regular maintenance prevents technical debt accumulation
- Focus on incremental improvements rather than major rewrites

*This maintenance task list focuses on enhancing and sustaining the already implemented n8n-MCP server. Tasks are prioritized by impact and can be executed incrementally without disrupting the production system.*
