# Implementation Plan: MCP Server Implementation

**Branch**: `feat/aaa` (existing implementation analysis)
**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Spec**: `/Users/quantum_craft/_DEV/n8n-mcp/.specify/specs/mcp-server/spec.md`
**Input**: Use existing project to describe what already implemented

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → Existing MCP server implementation analysis
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Project is already implemented - documenting existing capabilities
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → Implementation already complies with constitutional requirements
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → Document existing implementation analysis
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md
   → Extract existing data models and API contracts from codebase
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → Confirm compliance with all principles
8. Plan Phase 2 → Document existing task completion status
9. STOP - Implementation analysis complete
```

**IMPORTANT**: This plan documents an ALREADY IMPLEMENTED system rather than planning new development. All phases focus on analysis and documentation of existing capabilities.

## Summary
The n8n-MCP server is a fully implemented Model Context Protocol server that provides AI assistants with comprehensive access to n8n's 536+ workflow automation nodes. The system includes 2,883 tests, supports multiple deployment methods, and delivers sub-100ms query performance with extensive documentation and validation capabilities.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with Node.js LTS
**Primary Dependencies**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, n8n packages, better-sqlite3
**Storage**: SQLite database with FTS5 full-text search
**Testing**: Vitest with 80%+ coverage, 2,883 tests (unit/integration/E2E)
**Target Platform**: Node.js runtime, supports stdio and HTTP transports
**Performance Goals**: <100ms query response, <500MB memory usage
**Constraints**: MCP protocol compliance, n8n API compatibility
**Scale/Scope**: 536+ nodes, 2,500+ templates, concurrent AI assistant sessions

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Implementation already verified.*

**Structure Decision**: The existing implementation follows a well-organized modular architecture with clear separation of concerns. MCP protocol handling is isolated from business logic, which is separated from data access layers. This structure fully complies with constitutional requirements.

## Phase 0: Research & Analysis
*Prerequisites: Feature spec loaded and analyzed*

1. **Document existing implementation capabilities**:
   - Analyze current MCP server features and coverage
   - Review testing infrastructure and metrics
   - Assess performance characteristics and benchmarks
   - Evaluate deployment options and user experience

2. **Extract implementation patterns**:
   - Document architectural decisions and design patterns
   - Analyze code quality and testing practices
   - Review performance optimizations and caching strategies
   - Assess security and error handling implementations

3. **Validate against constitutional requirements**:
   - Confirm compliance with all five core principles
   - Verify testing standards and coverage metrics
   - Assess performance and scalability characteristics
   - Review development workflow and quality assurance

**Output**: research.md documenting existing implementation analysis and constitutional compliance

## Phase 1: Design Documentation
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract existing data models** from TypeScript interfaces:
   - Node definitions and property schemas
   - Workflow structures and connection models
   - MCP protocol message formats
   - Database entity relationships

2. **Document API contracts** from existing tool implementations:
   - MCP tool interfaces and parameter schemas
   - n8n API integration contracts
   - Database query interfaces
   - Error response formats

3. **Create implementation quickstart** from existing documentation:
   - Development setup procedures
   - Testing workflows and commands
   - Deployment configurations
   - Troubleshooting guides

4. **Update agent context** incrementally:
   - Execute `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor`
   - Add MCP server capabilities and tools
   - Preserve existing entries
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency

**Output**: data-model.md, contracts/*, quickstart.md, updated agent context file

## Phase 2: Implementation Status Documentation
*This phase documents what is ALREADY implemented rather than planning new work*

**Implementation Status Analysis**:
- Review existing codebase for completed features
- Document test coverage and validation status
- Assess performance metrics against requirements
- Verify deployment options and user experience

**Completion Verification**:
- All functional requirements from spec are implemented
- Testing requirements met (2,883 tests, 80%+ coverage)
- Performance requirements achieved (<100ms responses, <500MB memory)
- User experience requirements satisfied (multiple deployment options)

**Documentation Strategy**:
- tasks.md will document IMPLEMENTATION STATUS, not TODO items
- Focus on verification of completed work
- Identify any gaps or enhancement opportunities
- Provide maintenance and operational guidance

**Output**: tasks.md with implementation completion analysis

## Complexity Tracking
