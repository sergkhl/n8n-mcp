## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an AI assistant developer, I want comprehensive access to n8n's 500+ workflow automation nodes so I can help users build accurate, well-configured workflows by understanding node capabilities, required properties, and real-world usage patterns.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an AI assistant needs to find Slack nodes, **When** searching for "slack", **Then** it receives accurate node information with properties and examples
2. **Given** an AI assistant needs to validate a node configuration, **When** calling validation tools, **Then** it gets detailed feedback on configuration correctness
3. **Given** an AI assistant needs workflow templates, **When** searching templates, **Then** it finds relevant examples with proper attribution
4. **Given** an AI assistant has n8n API access, **When** managing workflows, **Then** it can create, update, and execute workflows safely

### Edge Cases
- What happens when searching for non-existent nodes?
- How does the system handle outdated n8n versions?
- What happens with malformed MCP protocol requests?
- How are performance limits handled under high load?
